    Given as input a mini-batch of few-shot episodes, it applies the
    forward and (optionally) backward propagation routines of the few-shot
    classification task. Each episode consists of (1) num_train_examples number
    of training examples for the novel classes of the few-shot episode, (2) the
    labels of training examples of the novel classes, (3) num_test_examples
    number of test examples of the few-shot episode (note that the test
    examples can be from both base and novel classes), and (4) the labels of the
    test examples. Each mini-batch consists of meta_batch_size number of
    few-shot episodes. The code assumes that the few-shot classification model
    is divided into a feature extractor network and a classification head
    network.

    Args:
    feature_extractor: The feature extractor neural network.
    feature_extractor_optimizer: The parameter optimizer of the feature
        extractor. If None, then the feature extractor remains frozen during
        training.
    classifier: The classification head applied on the output of the feature
        extractor.
    classifier_optimizer: The parameter optimizer of the classification head.
    images_train: A 5D tensor with shape
        [meta_batch_size x num_train_examples x channels x height x width] that
        represents a mini-batch of meta_batch_size number of few-shot episodes,
        each with num_train_examples number of training examples.
    labels_train: A 2D tensor with shape
        [meta_batch_size x num_train_examples] that represents the discrete
        labels of the training examples of each few-shot episode in the batch.
    labels_train_1hot: A 3D tensor with shape
        [meta_batch_size x num_train_examples x num_novel] that represents
        the 1hot labels of the training examples of the novel classes of each
        few-shot episode in the batch. num_novel is the number of novel classes
        per few-shot episode.
    images_test: A 5D tensor with shape
        [meta_batch_size x num_test_examples x channels x height x width] that
        represents a mini-batch of meta_batch_size number of few-shot episodes,
        each with num_test_examples number of test examples.
    labels_test: A 2D tensor with shape
        [meta_batch_size x num_test_examples] that represents the discrete
        labels of the test examples of each few-shot episode in the mini-batch.
    is_train: Boolean value that indicates if this mini-batch will be
        used for training or testing. If is_train is False, then the code does
        not apply the backward propagation step and does not update the
        parameter optimizers.
    base_ids: A 2D tensor with shape [meta_batch_size x num_base], where
        base_ids[m] are the indices of the base categories that are being used
        in the m-th few-shot episode. num_base is the number of base classes per
        few-shot episode.
    feature_name: (optional) A string or list of strings with the name of
        feature level(s) from which the feature extractor will extract features
        for the classification task.
    classification_coef: (optional) the loss weight of the few-shot
        classification task.

    Returns:
    record: A dictionary of scalar values with the following items:
        'loss': The cross entropy loss of this mini-batch.
        'AccuracyNovel': The classification accuracy of the test examples among
            only the novel classes.
        'AccuracyBase': (optinional) The classification accuracy of the test
            examples among only the base classes. Applicable, only if there are
            test examples from base classes in the mini-batch.
        'AccuracyBase': (optinional) The classification accuracy of the test
            examples among both the base and novel classes. Applicable, only if
            there are test examples from base classes in the mini-batch.
